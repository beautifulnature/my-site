# Newsletter 1 – Faster Solves and a First Case Study

## What’s new

We shipped an update that reduces solve times on large routing and scheduling models.  
You’ll notice snappier runs when experimenting with multiple scenarios in a row.

## Customer story highlight

A logistics team used our routing model to automate daily dispatch.  
They now build a plan in minutes and spend the rest of their time managing exceptions.

## Learning resources

- Blog: Time window patterns for real-world routing  
- Video: Building your first routing model end-to-end  

## Upcoming events

We’re planning an AMA-style session focused on modeling tricky constraints.  
Reply with topics you’d like to see covered.
