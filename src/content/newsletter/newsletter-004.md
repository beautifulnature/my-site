# Newsletter 4 – From Prototype to Production

## Hardening your model

We collected best practices for moving from a proof-of-concept spreadsheet to a robust planning model.  
Topics include versioning, testing constraints, and monitoring solve quality over time.

## Customer spotlight

A manufacturing client stabilized their production schedule by encoding maintenance windows and setup times.  
They now re-plan daily without constant fire drills.

## Events

- Workshop: Scheduling in practice (London)  
- Webinar: Deep dive into vehicle routing with time windows  

## What’s next

We’re working on sample dashboards that visualize plan quality over time.  
Expect more on reporting and monitoring in the next release.
