# Newsletter 5 – Community, Docs, and Roadmap

## Community updates

More teams are sharing their planning use cases and model snippets.  
We’ll highlight interesting patterns and reusable pieces in future newsletters.

## Documentation refresh

The docs now include clearer quickstarts, updated API examples, and troubleshooting guides.  
If you’re new to planning, the “start here” path is a good entry point.

## Roadmap preview

We’re exploring higher-level building blocks for common scenarios like shift rostering and field service routing.  
The goal is to reduce boilerplate so you can focus on modeling your unique rules.

## Keep the feedback coming

Reply with topics you want us to cover next—performance, data modeling, or integration patterns.
