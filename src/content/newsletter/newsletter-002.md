# Newsletter 2 – New Tutorials and Example Models

## New tutorials

We added step-by-step guides for:

- Building a shift roster with fairness rules  
- Creating a small field service routing example  
- Modeling a production schedule with setup times

## Example models

The examples repository now contains ready-to-run models with sample data.  
You can fork them, plug in your own CSVs, and see results quickly.

## Community questions

A common question this month: how to debug infeasible models.  
We’re preparing a dedicated article that walks through typical pitfalls and fixes.
