# HealthCarePlus Improves Rosters and Staff Satisfaction

## Company

HealthCarePlus operates several clinics with rotating staff and strict coverage requirements.

## Challenge

Manual rosters struggled to balance legal rules, staff preferences, and patient coverage.  
Managers spent days negotiating shifts and fixing conflicts.

## Solution

We implemented a rostering model that encodes rules, preferences, and fairness constraints.  
Managers use it to generate draft schedules, then adjust a small number of shifts manually.

## Results

- Rostering time reduced by more than half  
- Fewer violations of rest and contract rules  
- Improved staff satisfaction with more predictable schedules
