# ShopFast Speeds Up Fulfillment with Slotting Optimization

## Company

ShopFast runs a busy fulfillment center serving multiple marketplaces.

## Challenge

Pickers were walking long distances and orders with similar items were scattered across aisles.  
Any change in demand patterns required weeks of manual re-slotting.

## Solution

We modeled the warehouse layout and demand data and used a slotting optimization model.  
Frequently co-ordered items are grouped, and high-velocity products are placed closer to packing stations.

## Results

- 20% reduction in average pick path length  
- Faster onboarding for new pickers  
- A repeatable process for adapting to seasonal demand
