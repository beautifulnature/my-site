# FactoryOne Stabilizes Production with Automated Scheduling

## Company

FactoryOne produces custom parts with shared machines and limited changeover capacity.

## Challenge

Schedulers were juggling urgent orders, maintenance windows, and setup times in spreadsheets.  
This led to frequent rescheduling and missed internal deadlines.

## Solution

We modeled the shop floor as a scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times and maintenance tasks.  
The scheduler now runs a scenario each morning and chooses the best plan based on KPIs.

## Results

- Fewer urgent reschedules and weekend shifts  
- Better adherence to promised lead times  
- Clear visibility into machine utilization
