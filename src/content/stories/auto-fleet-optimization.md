# AutoFleet Cuts Empty Miles by 25%

## Company

AutoFleet Logistics moves new vehicles between factories, ports, and dealers.

## Challenge

Planners were manually stitching together routes under tight delivery windows and loading rules.  
Empty miles and overtime costs kept creeping up as volumes grew.

## Solution

We modeled their operations as a vehicle routing problem with time windows, capacity, and loading constraints.  
The planning team now starts from an automatically generated plan and only adjusts special cases.

## Results

- 25% reduction in empty miles  
- Planning time cut from hours to minutes  
- Fewer last-minute changes and missed delivery slots
