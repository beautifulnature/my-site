# FieldCare Boosts First-Visit Resolution with Smart Routing

## Company

FieldCare maintains equipment for customers across multiple cities.

## Challenge

Technicians were spending too much time on the road and not enough time solving issues.  
Routes didn’t consider skills, SLAs, or realistic travel times.

## Solution

We introduced a routing model that combines travel times, technician skills, and customer priorities.  
The solver builds daily plans that match the right technician to each job while minimizing travel.

## Results

- 18% reduction in travel time  
- Higher first-visit resolution rate  
- Clearer, more predictable technician schedules
