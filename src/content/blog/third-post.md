## Bus Scheduling Insights

Bus scheduling is a real-world optimization challenge. You must balance passenger demand, route coverage, and timing. Matrices can represent stops, times, and capacities, making it easier to analyze and improve schedules.

## Optimization Tips

- Map out all stops and times in a matrix.
- Use constraints for driver shifts and bus capacities.
- Simulate different schedules to find the best fit.

Efficient bus scheduling improves service and reduces costs—experiment with your own models!
