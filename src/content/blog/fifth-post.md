# fifth-post

This is your first blog-style post.

## Docs, Math, Notes

Use the Docs section for narrative, the Math section for equations, and Notes for daily logs.

## Next Steps

Add more posts under `src/content/blog/` and they will appear on the blog index automatically.

## Road Network Optimization

Optimizing road networks involves analyzing traffic flow, intersections, and constraints like speed limits. Matrices can represent connections and traffic volumes, helping you identify bottlenecks and improve efficiency.

## Best Practices

- Build a matrix of intersections and roads.
- Apply constraints for traffic rules and safety.
- Use simulation tools to test improvements.

Road optimization leads to safer, faster travel—try modeling your own city!
