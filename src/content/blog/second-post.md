## Vehicle Routing Problem

Optimizing car routes is a classic problem. You want to minimize travel time and fuel costs while ensuring all destinations are reached. Matrices help model distances and constraints, such as maximum load or time windows.

## Key Strategies

- Use distance matrices for route planning.
- Apply constraints for real-world limitations.
- Experiment with algorithms like Dijkstra or A* for shortest paths.

Optimization in transportation saves money and time—try it in your next project!
