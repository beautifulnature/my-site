## Constraint Programming in Action

Constraint programming is a powerful tool for solving complex problems. By defining variables and constraints, you can model everything from scheduling to resource allocation.

## How to Start

- Identify your variables and constraints.
- Use a matrix to visualize relationships.
- Apply solvers to find optimal solutions.

Constraint programming unlocks new possibilities—explore it in your projects!
